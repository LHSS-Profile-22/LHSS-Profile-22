    70% of students would choose SE again if they could go back to high
    school.
  </span>
  Computer Science is a popular alternative because it has
  more course flexibility. Unlike SE, Computer Science does not have a cohort
  which makes it harder for CS students to meet others.

<h3> Customizing the experience </h3>
<p class="full">
There are many ways students can make the best of their time in university. As a
software engineering student, it is normal for students to attend a few hackathons,
build some side projects, intern as a software engineer in Silicon Valley.
<br /><br />
However, several students took the extra leap of faith to make the most of their
university experience. Here are some of their stories:

    <span class="big path-title">Transitioning into design</span>
    <p>
I’ve always seen myself as an outsider among my peers in more ways than one. Outside of class, I invested my time in pursuits like illustration, photography, and fashion blogging. When I learned about product design, a field that bridged computing and design, I knew this was it.
      <br /><br />
I’m grateful I took the leap that landed me my first product role because once I was surrounded by a community of designers with passions similar to my own, I knew I finally belonged.

    <span class="big path-title">Starting a tech club for nonprofits</span>
    <p>
      On one of my co-ops I met a member of a Berkeley student club called Blueprint, where students build tech for nonprofits. I loved the idea of it since it combined my skills in tech with my passion for volunteering. With another girl, I started the Waterloo chapter of the club.
      <br /><br />
      We've gotten to work with some amazing non-profits, whose missions range from cataloging the world's dying languages to the preservation of bumblebees to investing in entrepreneurs in rural Kenya. It's been a lot of hard work, and at times it left me feeling burnt out, but it's been an incredible experience.

    <span class="big path-title">Exploring data science</span>
    <p>
      I saw data science as a way to grow my skill set in a way that differentiated me
      from other software engineers. I believe having an internship in data science has
      had a larger impact on my personal and career growth than completing another
      software engineering internship.
      <br /><br />
      Throughout my data science internships I've
      learned various analysis and communication skills that will benefit me no matter
      what position I decide to pursue. I feel lucky to have had people believe in me
      to jump into a completely different role with no previous experience.

    <p>
      I've always been interested in the mind, so when I saw the option for a minor in cognitive science, I thought, why not?
      <br /><br />
      I'm somewhat torn by the end of it. I missed out on some courses, but I took others that I really enjoyed (like a seminar course that I did a research experiment in!). I could've taken these without being enrolled in the minor though, so my advice is to just take courses you're interested in and not stress about the minor.

    <span class="big path-title">Stumbling into product management</span>
    <p>
      During my 2nd co-op, I ended up having to do customer support part-time for a month which helped me build user empathy. I was also involved with the Product Vision Club, a product management community.
      <br /><br />
      I was hooked and ended up leading the club as well as organizing Canadian
      Undergraduate Technology Conference.
      Taking the risk to put myself in uncomfortable situations helped me
      transition into product roles early on, and I’ve loved the world of
      product management ever since.

    <p>
      At the end of my third year, Marcus and me had an opportunity to join an
      early-stage startup building autonomous semi trucks. In coordination with the SE Program, I was able to finish my degree remotely by submitting assignments online and flying back for exams. During this time, I got to be a part of Embark’s incredible journey as we grew from a small team of 5 engineers to one of the leading players in the self-driving space.
      <br /><br />
      Taking this unconventional path gave Marcus and I incredible experience beyond my schooling that will follow me throughout my career.
