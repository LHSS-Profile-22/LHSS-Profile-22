<h3> Looking back </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    70% of students would choose SE again if they could go back to high
    school.
  </span>
  Computer Science is a popular alternative because it is less rigorous and has
  more course flexibility. Unlike SE, Computer Science does not have a cohort
  which makes it harder for CS students to meet others.

  51% of the class rated SE a max rating score, and 87% of the class rated above
  a 4 out of 5. Shoutouts to the Faculty of Software Engineering and the class
