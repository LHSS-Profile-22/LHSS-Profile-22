<h1> Future </h1>
<h3> Post-graduation plans </h3>

  <span class="big">
    As of 5 months before graduation, 77% of students already have an offer, and 15% of students are
    still looking for a job.
  </span>
  7 students are planning to do graduate studies after
  graduating. Although most of the class plans to join the workforce immediately,
  34% of students are  considering to do grad school at some point in the future.
  <br/><br/>

  Even though 80% of the class has worked in California, less than half of
  students have chosen to live in California after graduating. Although California
  is perceived by many as the place to be for software engineering, seeing the gap
  in the conversion rate suggests that there are many other great places for
  software engineering such as East Coast Canada, East Coast US and Pacific North
  West US.
