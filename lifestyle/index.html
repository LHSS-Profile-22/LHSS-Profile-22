<h3> Exercise </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Almost 80% of students exercise at least a few times a month.
  </span>
  This could be in the form of intramurals, gym, sports team, etc.
  Students typically start SE intramural teams with one another.
  Although school is time consuming, most students actively set
  aside time for physical activities.

<h3> Cooking </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Over half of students cook every week.
  </span>
  In other words, many of us have a
  lot of experience cooking. How good is our cooking? That’s a completely
  separate question that may be better left unanswered.

  <br/> <br />
  These results vary depending on whether students are on a study or co-op
  term, since many companies cater meals during weekdays.

<h3> Sleeping </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Software engineers may have a reputation for being nocturnal, but most of
  SE students aren’t night owls.
  </span>
  In fact, 72% of students usually sleep before 1AM.
  However, some students do still prefer sleeping late, possibly because they
  focus better at night, or maybe they like gaming very late.
  <br /> <br />
  5:00AM-6:00AM might sound crazy, but then again, SE students willingly go to 24 hour
  coding events called hackathons.

<h3> Extracurriculars </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">Unlike high school, almost half of students were not involved in any
    extracurriculars during undergrad.
  </span>
  Amongst those that were involved, almost
  every student were the only SE 2018 student in their respective extracurricular
  activity.
  <br /><br />
  Most students did not pursue any extracurricular activities related to STEM.

<h2> Coding </h2>

<h3> Programming language</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Python is the most popular programming language.
  </span>
  Python’s versatility for back-end web, scripting, and especially machine learning could explain
  why it is so popular in our class. Many of these disciplines are highly in-demand
  in the software engineering, making Python an ideal general purpose language.

  <br /> <br />
  Java continues to be very popular since it is
  commonly taught as students' first programming language in high school.

  <br /> <br />
  Many companies hire web developers for
  co-op, which could explain why JavaScript, a scripting language for the web, is
  so popular. It also happens to be the most popular language amongst all
  developers <a rel="noopener" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#technology-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages"
    target="_blank">
    according to a StackOverflow survey</a>.

<h3> Editor </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  Sublime Text is the most popular text editor used in our class, followed by Vim
  and Atom.
  </span>
  Interestingly, Visual Studio Code is one of the less popular editors
  in our class but it is the most popular editor according to the same StackOverflow
  survey. This could be because it was released very recently after most
  students were already accustomed to their favourite editor.

<h3> Desktop OS </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  The majority of students are using a macOS machine.
  </span>
  This result isn’t surprising since
  macOS is built on top of Unix, enabling a lot of important functionality for
  programmers
  <br /> <br />
  Interestingly, most students didn’t have a macOS machine in first year. Many
  employers provided MacBooks as work laptops which introduced students to macOS's
  development environment. As a result, many students converted to being MacBook
  users during university.

<h3> Hackathons </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  More than 80% of students have gone to at least one hackathon.
  </span>
  They are especially popular at UWaterloo, home to Hack the North,
  Canada's biggest hackathon.
  <br /><br />
  According to Justin Trudeau, “Hack the North will give you a chance to not
  only let your imagination run wild, but to meet other people who can help
  you solve problems: mentors, friends and colleagues, who will challenge you
  to take your ideas a step further.”

<h3> Side projects </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Most students have also worked on some sort of side project during university.
  </span>
  Amongst those that have built side projects, only 25% dedicated more than 10
  hours a month to their side projects. This should be taken with a grain of
  salt since commitment may vary depending on the term and year.
  <br /><br />
  During the first few years of SE, side projects is often a means to getting
  a better co-op job because it compensates for the lack of software work experience.

<h3> Software Discplines</h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    57% of students enjoy an aspect of web development (front-end, back-end,
    full-stack).
  </span>
    Many co-op positions happen to be related to web development which explains
    why many students are more familar with it. Alternatively,
    students could just find web development the most fun. Interestingly, there
    are no course offerings in SE for web development unlike ML and AI.
  <br/><br/>

  After web development, 25% of students enjoy machine learning (ML) or
  artificial intelligence (AI). This aligns with the rising popularity and
  demand of both disciplines.
  <br/><br/>

  Only 3 students have expressed interest in mobile development. This is
  surprising because of both how high in-demand it is and how ubiquitous it is
  amongst consumers.
