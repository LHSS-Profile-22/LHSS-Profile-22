<h1> Interests and lifestyle</h1>
<h2> General </h2>

  activities.

<h3> Cooking </h3>
<p class="half">
  Over half of students cook every week. In other words, many of us have a
  lot of experience cooking. How good our cooking is? That’s a completely
  different question that may be better left unanswered.

<h3> Sleeping </h3>
<p class="half">
  Although software engineers may have a reputation for being nocturnal, most of
  us aren’t night owls. In fact, 72% of students usually sleep before 1AM.
  However, many students do still prefer sleeping late, possibly because they can
  focus better in the silence, or simply because they like gaming very late.

<h2> Coding </h2>

<h3> Programming language</h3>
<p class="half">
  Python is the most popular programming language, followed by Java, and then JavaScript.
  <br/> <br/>
  Python’s versatility for web, scripting, and even machine learning could explain
  why it’s so popular in our class. Java continues to be very popular since it’s
  commonly taught in high school. And many companies hire web developers for
  co-op, which could explain why JavaScript, a scripting language for the web, is
  so popular.

<h3> Editor </h3>
<p class="half">
  Sublime Text is the most popular text editor used in our class, followed by Vim
  and Atom. Interestingly, Visual Studio Code is one of the least popular editors
  in our class but it is the most popular editor according to a StackOverflow
  survey.

<h3> Desktop OS </h3>
<p class="half">
  The majority of students are using a macOS machine. Interestingly, most students
  didn’t have a macOS machine in first year. This result isn’t surprising since
  macOS is built on top of Unix, enabling a lot of important functionality for
  programmers

  hours a month on their side projects.

<h3> Discplines</h3>
<p class="half">
  57% of students enjoy an aspect of web development (front-end, back-end,
  full-stack). This could be explained by the positions available for our co-op
  terms, since many of them were related to web development.
  <br/><br/>

  After web development, 25% of students enjoy machine learning (ML) or
  artificial intelligence (AI). This aligns with the rising popularity of both disciplines.
  <br/><br/>

  Only 3 students have expressed interest in mobile development. This is
  surprising because of both how high in demand it is and how ubiquitous it is
  amongst consumers.
