<h1> Background </h1>
<h2> Demographics </h2>
<h3> Gender </h3>
<p class="half two-third">
  Women make up 17% of the students, which is approximately the same proportion as
  the number of women in tech. Although the gender ratio isn’t something to be
  satisfied with, the trend is positive: the proportion of female students in
  more-recent SE classes has been increasing.

<h3> High school extracurriculars</h3>
<p class="half two-third">
  Less than 35% of students were involved in a STEM, CS or Robotics club during
  high school. Instead, students participated in all sorts of extracurricular
  activities such as volunteer work for non-profits, being a cadet, starting a
  school newspaper, and more. Pursuing their own unique personal interests was a
  common pattern amongst students during high school.

<h3> Level of education </h3>
<p class="half two-third">
  There are more parents with Masters and PhD’s combined than Bachelors. Compared
  to their parents, only 3 students out of 113 chose to do grad school. This could
  either be a generational shift, or it could just be that students are tired of
  school after 5 years with no summer.
