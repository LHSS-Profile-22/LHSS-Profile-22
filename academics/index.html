<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Attendance consistently drops term by term, except after the
  hardest term.
</span>
Either students enjoyed their 4A classes more, or they were possibly looking to
compensate for their lower grades in 3B.
<br /><br />
  Alternatively, students attend slightly more class more during summer terms
  (2B and 4A).

<h2> Courses </h2>
<h3> Favourite required courses </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Although 3B was the most difficult term, it had Concurrency (CS343), the most popular course.
</span>
  The top 8 favourited courses were all between 2A and 3B. Although
  these terms are slightly more difficult, they also happen to have the most
  interesting content for students.
  <br /><br />
  Students are also required to take several technical electives to fulfill
  their credits.  The most popular electives included Graphics (CS488),
  Distributed Computing (ECE 454), and Human-Computer Interaction (CS 449).

<h3> Least favourite required courses </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    3B also had Feedback Controls (SE 380), the most disliked course, which
    explains why it was the hardest term.
  </span>
  Although SE 463 is just as disfavoured, it was a much easier course, which explains why 4A
  was an easier term.
  <br /><br />
  It's important to note that courses that were disliked do not imply that
  students find the content useless. Instead, there are a variety of factors
  such as personal interests, final grade, assignments. For example, Logic and
  Computation (SE 212) is considered as useful to 88% of students
  <a href="https://uwflow.com/course/se212" target="_blank">
    according to UWFlow.</a>

<h2> Does X affect grades?</h2>

<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  There was no correlation between self-reported attendance and grades.
</span>
To be clear, this does not conclude nor suggest that not going to class is
beneficial. Instead, it suggests that it is possible to achieve good grades without
attending all classes.

<h3> Parents' education </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Grades are slightly higher when at least one parent had a university-level degree.
  </span>
  This suggests that there's a correlation between parents' education and how
  academically inclined students are.
