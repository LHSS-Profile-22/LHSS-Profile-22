<h3> Grades </h3>
<p class="half third">
  Study terms do not get progressively harder or easier. There is a consensus on
  which terms are the hardest and easiest though. 3B was by far the hardest term,
  followed by 2B and 3A. Students found 1A to be the easiest, followed by 4A.

<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half two-third">
We found no correlation between self-reported attendance and grades. To be
clear, this does not conclude nor suggest that going to class is useless.
It does suggest that it is possible to achieve good grades without attending
all classes.
<br/> </br>
Attendance consistently drops term by term, except after the hardest term.
Either students enjoyed their 4A classes more, or they were possibly looking to
compensate for their lower grades in 3B.
