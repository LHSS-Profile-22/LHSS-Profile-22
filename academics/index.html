<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  Attendance consistently drops term by term, except after the
  hardest term.
</span>
Either students enjoyed their 4A classes more, or they were possibly looking to
compensate for their lower grades in 3B.
<br /><br />
  Alternatively, students attend slightly more class more during summer terms
  (2B and 4A).

<h3> Least favourite courses </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    3B also had SE 380, the most disliked course, which explains why it was the hardest
    term.
  </span>
  Although SE 463 is just as disliked, it is an easy course, which explains why 4A
  was an easy term. TODO.

<h2> Does X affect grades?</h2>

<h3> Attendance </h3>
<p class="half">
<span class="big">
  There was no correlation between self-reported attendance and grades.
</span>
To be clear, this does not conclude nor suggest that going to class isn't
useful. Instead, it suggests that it is possible to achieve good grades without
attending all classes.

<h3> Parents' education </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Grades are slightly higher when at least one parent had a university-level degree.
  </span>
  This suggests that there's a correlation between parents' education and how
  academically inclined students are.
