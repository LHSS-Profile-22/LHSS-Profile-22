Class Profile Web
=========================

# About
The Software Engineering Class Profile is a student-initiative focused on showcasing what the program was like for students. It covers content covering co-op, background, academics, lifestyle, future plans, and answers questions such as “Does it matter if I started coding later than everyone else?” or “How much debt do students graduate with?”.

You can view the class profile at [https://classprofile.andyzhang.net](https://classprofile.andyzhang.net).

# Setup
**You need a Ruby version at least < 3.0 (2.7.0 works)!**

Run `yarn install`. You'll also need `jekyll` to run a local host. Run `gem install jekyll` if you don't have it.

# Running Locally
- `npm run prod` (build the TypeScript Code) will update the `min.js` file in the `build` directory.
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` run the jekyll server
