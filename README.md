Class Profile Web
=========================

# About
The Software Engineering Class Profile is a student-initiative focused on showcasing what the program was like for students. It covers content covering co-op, background, academics, lifestyle, future plans, and answers questions such as “Does it matter if I started coding later than everyone else?” or “How much debt do students graduate with?”.

You can view the class profile at [https://classprofile.andyzhang.net](https://classprofile.andyzhang.net).

# Setup
Run `yarn install`. You'll also need `jekyll` to run a local host. Run `gem install jekyll` if you don't have it.
