<h1> Co-op </h1>
<h3> Companies </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    At least 300 companies from 58 different cities have hired an SE student.
  </span>
  Students had the opportunity to work in many different types of environments,
  including working at a 5 person startup, writing code in Kenya,
  researching with professors, and working at a big tech company.
  While a majority of students were software engineers during their co-ops,
  some explored other areas such as design, product management, finance and consulting.
  <br /> <br />
  The benefit of having 6 co-op terms is that students get to explore different
  company sizes doing different positions in different cities. This is
  invaluable for students because it helps students figure out what they want
  upon graduation.

<h3> Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    91% of students co-oped in at least 2 different countries.
  </span>
  One of the factors behind only 9% of students interning in Canada were
  restrictions from work visas which primarily affects non-Canadians.
  <br /><br />
  The majority that co-oped in the US worked in California and specifically in Silicon Valley.
  One of the reasons for this is because Silicon Valley is the headquarters for many
  large tech companies that hire software engineers such as Google, Facebook,
  Apple, etc.
  <br /><br />
  During 5 of the 6 co-op terms, there was at least one student working outside
  of North America. This included cities such as Stockholm, Nairobi, Phnom
  Penh, Shanghai, Tokyo, etc.

<h3> Favourite Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    31% of students that worked in California preferred working elsewhere.
  </span>
  While California is still preferred by most, this suggests that it is not
  for everyone. The infamous ‘Cali or Bust’ mentality could have hindered
  some students from exploring opportunities in other cities that may have
  been better suited for them.

<h3> Salary </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    By the last co-op term, salaries tripled in comparison to the first.
  </span>
  Average monthly salaries per co-op term were <b>$2914, $4236, $5895, $7981, $9338,
    $10015</b> (in CAD).
  <br /><br />
  The difference could be explained by the increase in salaries and
  stipends to compensate for the difference in living costs between different
  locations. For example, San Francisco housing typically costs a student between
  $1,500 to $2,500 per month. In comparison, Waterloo housing costs a student
  approximately $700 per month.

<h2> Does X affect job pay? </h2>
<h3> Salary as a metric </h3>
<p class="full">
In order to rank jobs appropriately, salary is used as a proxy metric to
measure job opportunities. Due to the subjectiveness of this metric, the following
results should be taken with a grain of salt because higher salary does not
imply higher job satisfaction.
</p>

<div class="vbx2"></div>
<h3> Grades </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Grades do not correlate with salary at all.
  </span>
  In other words, having a cumulative average does not imply that the student
  will get a good salary in the upcoming co-op term. This suggests that there
  are more important factors than grades when it comes to finding a good job.
  <br /><br />
  Some companies do use grades as a cutoff to filter large amounts of candidates.
  However, many companies are aware that grades are not a good indication of how
  performant a student can be during co-op.
  <br /><br />
  This suggests that if a student wanted to optimize for getting the best co-op
  possible, aiming for a higher grade may not yield the desired results, and
  their efforts can be redirected towards other involvements such as side
  projects.

<h3> Years of coding experience </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students who started coding earlier were paid similarly compared to students who
    started coding later.
  </span>
  In other words, it doesn't matter if a student started at the age of 13 or 18. This suggests
  that students that started coding later are not at a disadvantage in terms
  of co-op job opportunities.

<h3> Hackathons </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students who attended at least one hackathon earned 18% more on average than those that
    didn't attend any.
  </span>
  In other words, students who show passion for building projects get better job
  opportunities than those that don't. Alternatively, this result could be
  because students that attended a hackathon cared more about getting a higher
  paying job.
  <br /> <br />
  Students who attended more than 5 hackathons earned approximately 27% more than
  those that only attended between 1 to 5 hackathons. This could suggest that the
  former had a lot more relevant work to show which is more appealing to
  employers.

<h3> Side projects </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students that build side projects earned 13% more on average than those that
    don't build side projects.
  </span>
  The more time that a student invests into side projects, the more they are likely
  to get paid. Side projects are often seen as the closest thing to software
  work experience, making it a great time investment to compensate for any lack
  of work experience.

  <br /> <br />
  It is important to mention that <b>side projects and hackathons are not the only way to find
  a job</b>. There have been many less practiced methods students have used to
  find job opportunities such as referrals, networking, etc.
  <br /> <br />
  It is just as important to note that <b>students who are not involved in software-related
  extracurriculars still find great jobs</b>. In fact,
  many SE students and faculty encourage pursuing interests besides software.

<h3> Admission average </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Admission averages have no significant impact on job pay.
  </span>
  A 90 in one school could be harder to achieve than a 99 in another school.
  In other words, admission averages are an inaccurate metric to determine
  how successful someone is because high schools do not standardize their grades
  with each other.
