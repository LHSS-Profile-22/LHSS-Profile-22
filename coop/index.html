<h1> Co-op </h1>
<h3> Companies </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    At least 300 companies from 58 different cities have hired an SE student.
  </span>
  Students had the opportunity to work in many different types of environments.
  For example, working at a 5 person startup, developing in Kenya, doing
  research with professors, working at a big tech company, etc. Some students also tried
  new positions outside of software engineering such
  as product designer, data scientist, associate quantitative trader,
  consulting, etc.
  <br /> <br />
  The benefit of having 6 internships is that students get to explore different
  company sizes doing different positions in different cities. This is
  invaluable for students because it helps us figure out what we want to do once
  we graduate.

<h3> Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    91% of students interned in at least 2 different countries.
  </span>
  Out of the 9% of students that only interned in Canada, some are restricted to
  working in Canada due to their Visa.
  <br /><br />
  After the 5th co-op, there is a decrease in the number of students working in
  the US. Most people that worked in the US worked in California, specifically
  in Silicon Valley. This makes sense because Silicon Valley is the HQ for many
  large tech companies that hire software engineers such as Google, Facebook,
  Apple, etc.
  <br /><br />
  During 5 of the 6 co-op terms, there was at least one student working outside
  of North America. Students worked in cities like Stockholm, Nairobi, Phnom
  Penh, Shanghai, Tokyo, etc.

<h3> Favourite Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big"> California was not the favourite co-op location for 43% of
    students.
  </span>
  Although it is still preferred by the majority of students, this suggests that
  it's not for everyone. This suggests that the infamous 'Cali or Bust'
  mentality can set up a significant number of current students for
  disappointment compared to other opportunities.

<h3> Salary </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    By their last co-op term, students tripled the salary of their first
    internship.
  </span>
  This is largely explained by the salary differences between different locations,
  extra stipends included in offers. These factors compensate for higher living
  costs, especially in San Francisco where housing easily costs between
  $2,000 to $3,000 USD per month.

<h2> Does X affect job opportunities? </h2>
<h3> Salary as a metric </h3>
<p class="full">
In order to rank jobs appropriately, salary is used as a subjective metric to
measure job quality. Due to the subjectiveness of this metric, the following
results should be taken with a grain of salt because higher salary does not
imply higher job satisfaction.
</p>

<div class="vbx2"></div>
<h3> Years of coding experience </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students who started coding earlier were paid similarly compared to students who
    started coding later.
  </span>
  It doesn't matter if a student started at the age of 13 or 18. This suggests
  that students that start coding near the start of university are not at a
  disadvantage in terms of co-op job hunting.

<h3> Hackathons </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students who attended at least one hackathon earned 18% more on average than those that
    didn't attend any.
  </span>
  In other words, students who show passion for building projects get better job
  opportunities than those that don't. Alternatively, this result could be
  because students that attended a hackathon cared more about getting a better
  job.
  <br /> <br />
  Students that attend more than 5 hackathons earned approximately 27% more than
  those that only attended between 1 to 5 hackathons. This could suggest that the
  former has a lot more relevant work to show which is more appealing to
  employers.
</p>

<h3> Side projects </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students that build side projects earn 13% more on average than those that
    don't build side projects.
  </span>
  The more time student invests into side projects, the more they are likely
  to get paid. Side projects are often seen as the closest thing to software
  work experience, making it a great time investment to compensate for any lack
  of work experience.

  <br /> <br />
  It's important to mention that <b>side projects and hackathons are not the only way to find
  a job</b>. There have been many less conventional ways students have used to
  find job opportunities such as referrals, activities, cold emails, etc.
  <br /> <br />
  It's just as important to note that <b>students who are not involved in software-related
  extracurriculars still find great jobs</b>. In fact, pursuing interests outside
  of software is encouraged, and is something many SE students encourage
  amongst each other.

<h3> Admission average </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Admission averages have no significant impact on early job opportunities.
  </span>
  A 90 in one school could be harder to achieve than a 99 in another school.
  In other words, admission averages are an inaccurate metric to determine
  how successful someone is because high schools do not standardize their grades
  with each other.
