<h1> Co-op </h1>
<h2> Where did students work? </h2>
<h3> Companies </h3>
<p class="full">
  <span class="big">
    With 6 available co-ops, students took full advantage and interned in all
    sorts of environments.
  </span>
  For example, working at a 5 person startup, developing in Kenya, doing
  research with professors, TA'ing a course, etc. Some students also tried
  new positions outside of software engineering such
  as product designer, data scientist, associate quantitative trader,
  consulting, etc.
  <br /> <br />
  The benefit of having 6 internships is that students get to explore different
  company sizes doing different positions in different cities. This is
  invaluable for students because it helps us figure out what we want to do once
  we graduate.

<h3> Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    91% of students interned in at least 2 different countries.
  </span>
  Out of the 9% of students that only interned in Canada, some are restricted to
  working in Canada due to their Visa.
  <br /><br />
  After the 5th co-op, there is a decrease in the number of students working in
  the US. Most people that worked in the US worked in California, specifically
  in Silicon Valley. This makes sense because Silicon Valley is the HQ for many
  large tech companies that hire software engineers such as Google, Facebook,
  Apple, etc.
  <br /><br />
  During 5 of the 6 co-op terms, there was at least one student working outside
  of North America. Students worked in cities like Stockholm, Nairobi, Phnom
  Penh, Shanghai, Tokyo, etc.

<h3> Favourite Locations </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big"> California was not the favourite co-op location for 43% of
    students.
  </span>
  Although it is still preferred by the majority of students, this suggests that
  it's not for everyone. This suggests that the infamous 'Cali or Bust'
  mentality can set up a significant number of current students for
  disappointment compared to other opportunities.

<h2> Does X affect job opportunities? </h2>
<h3> Salary as a metric </h3>
<p class="full">
In order to rank jobs appropriately, salary is used as a subjective metric to
measure job quality. Due to the subjectiveness of this metric, the following
results should be taken with a grain of salt. This is because lower paying jobs
can be enjoyed more depending on the person.

<h3> Years of coding experience </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Students who started coding earlier were paid similarly compared to students who
    started coding later.
  </span>
  It doesn't matter if a student started at the age of 13 or 18. This suggests
  that students that start coding near the start of university are not at a
  disadvantage in terms of co-op job hunting.
