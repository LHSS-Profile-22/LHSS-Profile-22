<h1> Foreword </h1>
<p class="full">
  The University of Waterloo’s Software Engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary
  program supported by both the Faculty of Mathematics and the Faculty of
  Engineering. For 5 years, the 141 students of the class of 2018 spent 8
  semesters in school with similar schedules as well as 6 internships.
  <br /><br />
  SE is commonly compared to Computer Science, and is often seen as its
  competitive and rigorous counterpart. Prospective students may wonder whether SE
  is the right fit for them, and whether they’ll enjoy the environment. This
  profile attempts to showcase aspects of SE students and their lives.

<h1> Preface </h1>

<p class="full">
The findings in this report were derived from the results of a class survey.
In total, 113 out of 141 (80%) students responded. In many ways (especially
class size), the class of 2018 is an outlier, and generalizations from this
class to other SE classes are risky.
  <br /><br />

Study terms are defined as 1A, 1B, 2A, up to 4B (8 terms). Coop terms are evenly
spread out between study terms, starting after 1B and ending before 4B.
  <br /><br />

This class profile was largely inspired from the SYDE 2017 class profile created
by Joey Loi and Atef Chaudhury.
