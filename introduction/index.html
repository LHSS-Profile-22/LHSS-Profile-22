<h1> About the program </h1>
<p class="full">
  The University of Waterloo’s Software Engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary
  program supported by both the Faculty of Mathematics and the Faculty of
  Engineering. For 5 years, all 141 graduating students of the class of 2018 spent 8
  semesters in school with similar schedules as well as 6 co-ops.
  <br /><br />
  SE is commonly compared to Computer Science, and is often seen as its more-constrained,
  engineering-oriented counterpart. Prospective students may wonder whether SE
  is the right fit for them, and whether they’ll enjoy the environment. This
  profile attempts to showcase who SE 2018 students are, what they've done, and
  how university went for students.

<h1> Preface </h1>

<p class="full">
The findings in this report were derived from the results of a class survey.
In total, 113 out of 141 (80%) graduating students responded. SE classes
can vary significantly depending on the year, so generalize from this survey
to other classes at your own risk.
  <br /><br />

Study terms are defined as 1A, 1B, 2A, up to 4B (8 terms). 4 month co-op terms
occur after every study term starting after 1B and ending before 4B.
<br /><br />

All analysis involving income is expressed in Canadian dollars (CAD). The exchange
rate used to convert from USD to CAD depends on time and is stated where
relevant. All salaries include monthly housing stipend or the monthly cost of
corporate housing if applicable.

This class profile was inspired from the Systems Design Engineering 2017 Class Profile created
by Joey Loi and Atef Chaudhury.
