  12.9% of the students in the class are international.
  </span>
  The class saw a 2.1% decrease in international students from 1A (15%) to 4B.
  This could be due to the higher tuition costs for international students, especially in Engineering.
  International term tuition fees, prior to the academic year 2018/19 where it was subject to a 62.1% fee increase, 
  were around $15000 for computer science students. This made the computer science program more cost beneficial to
  international students.

  International students came from countries such as China and India.
