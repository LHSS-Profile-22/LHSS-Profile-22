<h3> Gender </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    Women make up 17% of students, which is approximately the same proportion as
    the number of women in tech.
  </span>
  Although we are still working towards increasing the number of minority gender
  groups, we can see a positive increase within the recent SE classes
  <br /> <br />
  There are also many on-campus communities that supports the success of women in
  computer science at UWaterloo. For example,
  <a href="http://wics.uwaterloo.ca/about/">Women in Computer Science</a>, and
  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Women-Who-Code-Waterloo/"> Women Who Code Waterloo </a>.

  One student preferred not to disclose.

<h3> Ethnicity</h3>

<h3> International students </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  14% of students are international, which is 4% fewer than University of
  Waterloo as a whole.
  </span>
  This could be due to the higher tuition costs for international students, who
  pay 27% more than the average international tuition fee. This could also be
  caused by the Engineering Admissions having a max quota for international
  students.
  <br /> <br />
  International students came from countries including Nigeria, United Arab Emirates,
  China, Pakistan, South Korea, Indonesia.

<h2> Family background </h2>
<h3> Income </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    More than half of students come from families whose income is higher than
    the median Canadian family income ($76,000).
  </span>
  These numbers do not include income from co-op terms. The majority of students
  have a family income between $50,000 and $150,000.

<h3> Level of education </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
  There are more parents with Masters and Doctorates combined than Bachelors.
  </span>
  Compared to our parents, only 3 students out of 113 are planning on attending
  grad school. This could
  be a generational shift, or maybe it could just be that students are tired of
  school after 5 years with no summer.
