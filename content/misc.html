<h3> Burnout </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    We made it through Waterloo Engineering but not without some hurdles along the way.
  </span>
  On average, respondants felt burnout in 3.34 of 8 academic terms (~42%).
  The median and mode were both 2.
  <br /> <br /> <!-- Newline -->
  The results are heavily skewed towards the lower levels, meaning that
  most respondants found the academic aspect of SE manageable.

<h3> Physical Conflict </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    No one was involved in a physical fight outside of a martial arts setting
    during their degree.
  </span>
  This question was asked to get some signal on conflicts that SE students may have
  been involed in. All 49 respondants said they had never fought outside a sport
  setting.

<h3> Reddit Usage </h3>
<p class="half">
  <span class="big">
    The University of Waterloo had the world's most populated university subreddit
    until recently.
  </span>
  Needless to say, we're big redditors. Here is a breakdown of how many hours were
  spent by respondants on the platform.

Reflecting on our time at Waterloo means more than making some graphs. Here are
some stories over the past 5 years.

      "I got drunk at a work party on time in San Francisco on a work term. I don't
      remember anything that happened that night but I woke up in a hospital with
      vomit on my jeans, and was told I was found on the side of some street.
      <br /><br />
      Hospital and ambulance bills ended up costing me over $6000 USD, and my
      travel insurance didn't cover it because it was a 'self-inflicted injury'.
      Thankfully I had work insurance and only ended up paying $2000. I went in
      to work the next day.

      The team's parties no longer serve shots."
