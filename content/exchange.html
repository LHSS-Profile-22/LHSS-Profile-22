        Had there been more information about going on exchange,
        namely to address graduation concerns and course flexibility,
        and an easier application process, more softies would have gone
        on exchange. 
    </span>
    The exchange program was briefly introduced to us in our
    second year, during an optional seminar. It's then no wonder
    that, of the 54 responses received for the exchange section,
    85 % did not go on exchange.

        Of the 46 who said they had not gone on exchange, 16 said that they
        would have gone had:
    </p>
    <p>
        - there been more exposure to the exchange program;
    </p>
    <p>
        - the exchange application process been easier;
    </p>
    <p>
        - global events such as Covid and the Hong Kong unrest not been a thing.
